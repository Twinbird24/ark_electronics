			<p>ARK Electronics is a small home business started by me, Attila Komaromi, in 2009. I have been working with computers since I was a child, and built my first desktop computer when I was only 11 years old. Throughout the life of this small business I've dealt with a wide array of computer issues, from virus infections to hardware failures. I've learned a lot in the past few years and I'm always facing new challenges - but nothing I've failed to overcome.</p>

			<p>I have been working at my Kitchener home location for over 6 years now, serving most of the neighbors in my area. So next time you come across a technical issue, bring your computer to someone you can trust!</p>
